USMB2 for Z80
-------------
A tiny TCP/IP implementation for Z80 as well as an example
application that uses USMB2 to access a network share.

The makefile builds a tap file that can be loaded into
a sinclair spectrum that has an interface1 with RS-232.

The stack uses a slightly modified version of the SLIP
protocol to talk to a daemon that then bridges the packets
to a tun0 network on linux.
The difference to normal SLIP is that I have to escape also
bytes with the value 0x00.   It is not clear if this is a bug
in my environment or an issue with the rs232 library in z88dk.
(the rs232 code is VERY untested)


slip-tun.c is an example bridge that can bridge between the
fifo's for rx and tx for fuse and tun0.
It is an example, please modify or clean up before using.

See ../speccy-mapping-a-share.pcapng for an example of
a spectrum 48k + interface1 accessinf a network share.
